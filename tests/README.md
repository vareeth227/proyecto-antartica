# Tests (Vitest)

This folder contains example unit tests for the project using Vitest.

How to run:

1. Install dev dependencies (if you haven't):

   npm install

2. Run tests:

   npm test

Notes:
- Tests are ESM-style imports to match the project `type: "module"`.
- Add more tests here. Prefer pure functions or modules that are easy to mock.
